# Cool_GIF_Generator
GIF stands for Graphics interchange format which lets you create cool animated GIPHY or add animations on your own picture.
This project is all about creating cool GIFs (Deal With it) using OpenCV and DL Models for Facial Landmark detection and Face detection.
The input to our GIF generator would be an image of yours which is locally stored on your machine.
One can adjust various parameters in the config.json file as per their own choice and play around with them.

#HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT:
Download all the files and unzip the assets.zip file, which contains the trained ML models we need to employ in our python script.
Run the python script on command line or terminal and specifying the input path of your image

Have fun creating GIFs!!
